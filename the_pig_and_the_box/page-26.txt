Pig was so upset he sat down and started to cry.
"This magic box is nothing but trouble!" he sobbed, "It makes apples explode, it makes bananas disappear, and it makes coconuts eat turtles!"

"It doesn't do any of those things!" snapped Duck, "YOU did all those things! You should learn to SHARE!"

Duck was right! The magic box was doing what it was supposed to do! It was Pig who was nothing but trouble!

Pig decided to make things right. He decided not to use any more magic buckets ever again, and he replaced the old nasty sign with a new one that read:

**MAGIC SHARING BOX**
**USE IT!**
