Pig freaked out. He had a magic box! He was so happy he nearly danced like an orang-utan. He knew right away that he did not want to let anyone else use the box, because it belonged to him. Anyway, they would probably want to copy stinky things like old eggs and garlic.
So Pig put a sign next to the box that read:

**MAGIC BOX**
**ONLY PIG MAY USE IT**
**GO AWAY**

Then he carried his twenty-seven carrots and twenty-seven potatoes inside his house.

Before he could even close the door, a crazy squirrel ran up and started dancing like he had bees in his underwear.

"Lolipop Jones!" shouted the squirrel.

"What?" asked Pig.

"Lllllllolipop Jones!" replied the squirrel, so Pig slammed the door and went back to his dinner.
