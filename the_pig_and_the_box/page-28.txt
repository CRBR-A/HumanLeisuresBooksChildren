After that, Pig's life was much better.
People came from far and wide to use his magic box. Whenever they got their copies, they always left him some, too. Pig especially liked the vegetables.

After a while, Pig became an expert at cooking, and opened a family restaurant with booths and jukeboxes and chairs made out of upside-down buckets.

He called the restaurant "Lolipop Jones", but he didn't know why.

Everything turned out just fine.
