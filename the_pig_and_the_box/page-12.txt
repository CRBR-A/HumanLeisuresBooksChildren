"Wait a second!” said Pig, “What are you going to do with these apples? Ducks don't eat apples."
"Well—" began Duck.

"You LIE!" shouted Pig, and he got a bucket from his house.

"The apples go in here,” Pig said, “This is a magic bucket. If anyone but YOU tries to take an apple out of this bucket, all the apples will **EXPLODE!**"

“But but but…” said Duck.

“Go away!” shouted Pig, “I don’t trust you at all!”

He sent Duck away with her bucket full of apples, and went back inside his house to find his pot boiling over.
