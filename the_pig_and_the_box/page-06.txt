Inside the turnip was a plain wooden box.
"What an odd place to keep a box," said Pig, "Usually, you keep the turnips in a box, not the other way around. What silly person is going around putting boxes in turnips?"

Pig decided the box was a great place to put carrots. So he picked a carrot from his garden and threw it into the box.

Just then, something amazing happened! The box tipped over, and out of it spilled TWENTY-SEVEN CARROTS!

Pig said to himself: "I am quite certain I did not throw twenty-seven carrots in there just now. This makes as much sense as a cow wearing a tutu."

Pig had to make sure he wasnâ€™t going crazy. He very carefully threw just ONE potato into the box. In an instant, the box tipped over, and TWENTY-SEVEN POTATOES DROPPED OUT!
