**BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!**
Someone knocked at the door and scared Pig right onto his bum. He ran to the door, opened the door, and there on the doorstep was a duck named Duck.

"I would like to use your magic box please," said Duck, "I want to copy an apple, and I will pay you one gold coin!"

“Oh, all right,” said Pig.

They went outside to the box, and Pig let Duck throw her apple inside. The box tipped right over and TWENTY-SEVEN APPLES DROPPED OUT!

"Wacky-doodle-dandy!" said Duck.
