"Wait a second!” said Pig, “What are you going to do with these coconuts? Turtles don't eat coconuts."
Maurice took so long to reply that Pig thought he must be lying about something.

"You LIE!” shouted Pig, and he got another bucket from his house.

"The coconuts go in here,” Pig said, “This is a magic bucket. If you try and bring them anywhere but your kitchen, the bucket will **FLY BACK TO ME!**"

“But but but…” said Maurice.

“I don’t trust you at all, and you smell like CHEESE!” shouted Pig.

He sent Maurice away with his bucket full of coconuts, and went back inside his house to find his potatoes had turned to mush.
