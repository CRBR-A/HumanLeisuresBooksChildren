"Wait a second!” said Pig, “What are you going to do with these bananas? Bunnies don't eat bananas."
"Heh, funny story…" began Bunny.

"You LIE!" shouted Pig, and he got another bucket from his house.

"The bananas go in here,” Pig said, “This is a magic bucket. If I find out you're doing something bad with those bananas, all I have to do is jump up and down three times, and all the bananas will **DISAPPEAR!**"

“But but but…” said Bunny.

“Go away!” shouted Pig, “I don’t trust you either!”

He sent Bunny away with his bucket full of bananas, and went back inside his house to find his carrots on fire.
