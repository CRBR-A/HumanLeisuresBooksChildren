“Yoooooou cranky Pig!” yelled Bunny, running up the road.
"What happened to YOU?" gasped Pig and Duck.

"My grandma was making banana cream pie!" Bunny cried, "But when it came out of the oven, ALL THE BANANAS HAD DISAPPEARED! She was so mad, she THREW IT AT ME! You jumped three times, DIDN’T YOU, PIG?!” said Bunny.

“Um… well…” said Pig.

“Yoooooou… Pig!” yelled Maurice, running up the road wearing a coconut instead of his shell.

"What happened to YOU?" gasped Pig and Duck and Bunny.

"I tried to eat a coconut in my dining room, and all of a sudden the bucket flew away! One coconut hit me so hard, I ended up INSIDE IT! Why do I always have to eat in my kitchen, Pig?"

“Er… well…” said Pig.

"You look funny,” said Bunny to Maurice, “Can I roll you?"
