**BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!**
Someone knocked at the door and scared Pig right onto his nose. He ran to the door, opened the door, and there on the doorstep was a cute little bunny named Bunny.

"Lolipop Jones!" yelled Bunny.

"WHAT?" said Pig.

"I dunno, a crazy squirrel made me say it," said Bunny. "Anyway, I need to copy a banana for my grandma please! I brought you a gold coin, too!"

“Oh, all right,” said Pig.

They went outside to the box, and Pig let Bunny throw his banana inside. The box tipped right over and TWENTY-SEVEN BANANAS DROPPED OUT!

"Crazy, dude!" said Bunny.
