**BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!**
Someone knocked at the door and scared Pig right onto his eyeball! He ran to the door, opened the door, and there on the doorstep was a slow little turtle named Maurice.

"I've got a coconut," said Maurice.

"It's lovely," said Pig.

"I'd like a bunch,” said Maurice, “And I've got a gold coin, too." Pig just sighed.

They went outside to the box, and Pig let Maurice throw his coconut inside. The box tipped right over and TWENTY-SEVEN COCONUTS DROPPED OUT!

"Woo. Hoo." said Maurice slowly.
