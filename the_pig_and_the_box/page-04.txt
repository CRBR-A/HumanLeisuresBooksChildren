Once upon a time, in a small house in the country, there lived a lonely old pig named Pig. Like most pigs, he did not have a lot. Some days, he barely had enough food to eat. He was quite the unhappy hog.

One morning, Pig found an especially large turnip in his garden.

"That is one big turnip,” he said to himself. “I don't remember planting any turnips. Not even giant ones. This has to go."

So Pig pulled, and he yanked, and pulled some more until... **POP!** The turnip shot out of the ground and broke in two!
